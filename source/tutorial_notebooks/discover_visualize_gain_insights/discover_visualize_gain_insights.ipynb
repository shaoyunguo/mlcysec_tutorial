    "| `'png'`    | Standard-resolution PNG output | Suitable for general use; faster rendering and smaller output size. |\n",
    "| `'svg'`    | Scalable Vector Graphics (vector-based) | Best for publication-quality plots that scale without losing quality; ideal for LaTeX or web embedding. |\n",
    "| `'pdf'`    | Portable Document Format (vector-based) | Useful for exporting plots to reports; less common in notebooks. |\n",
    "| `'jpg'` / `'jpeg'` | Compressed raster format | Rarely used for plots due to lossy compression; generally not recommended for analysis. |\n"
